- 👋 Hi, I’m @UncleTwinkle
- 👀 I’m interested in dance, semiotics, movement notation systems and learning new skills
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of data analysis because I'm thinking about a career change
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate just yet -- taking some baby steps here
- 📫 How to reach me: Follow my instagram account @vixxwatts if you want to see pics of my cats and videos of my students dancing from time to time
